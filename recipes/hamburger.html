    <h1>Wendy's Hamburger</h1>
    <img src="hamburger.webp" alt="hamburger image" />

    <p>
      From its one-of-a-kind Frosty to its freshly made salads, Wendy's is known
      for deliciously innovative menu items. We all know that Wendy's uses
      fresh, never frozen, ingredients to make its hamburgers â€” but have you
      ever looked at a Wendy's hamburger and wondered why it's square instead of
      round?
    </p>

    <p>
      We know, looking at your hot and juicy hamburger before digging in may be
      a difficult task, but we're sure you've noticed the meat sticking out of
      the side of the round bun before. And there's a reason it's like that
      (multiple reasons, actually).
